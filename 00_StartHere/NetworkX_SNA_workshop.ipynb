This workshop is a gentle introduction to SNA using Python and NetworkX, a powerful and mature python library for the study of the structure, dynamics, and functions of complex networks.

    "Social Network Analysis is an analytical approach to investigate social structures and phenomena which is based on Graph Theory. This approach is essentially relational and structural because it focuses on the patterns of relations between entities in a social system modeling them as **networked structures**.\n",

From a mathematical point of view, these networked structures are modeled as **Graphs**.\n",

    "* A **Graph** $G=(V,E)$ consists of a set $V(G)$ of $n$ nodes and a set $E(G)$ of $m$ edges, each one linking a pair of nodes. The **order** of $G$ is its number of nodes $n$ and the **size** of $G$ is its number of edges $m$. Two nodes are adjacent if there is an edge that links them, and this edge is said to be incident with the two nodes it links. \n",
    "\n",
    "* A **subgraph** of $G$ is a graph whose nodes and edges are all in $G$. An **induced subgraph** $G[U]$ is a subgraph defined by a subset of nodes $U \\subseteq V(G)$ with all the edges in $G$ that link nodes in $U$. A subgraph is **maximal** in respect to some property if the addition of more nodes to the subgraph will cause the loss of that property.\n",
    "\n",
    "* A **path** is an alternating sequence of distinct nodes and edges in which each edge is incident with its preceding and following nodes. The length of a path is the number of edges it contains. A graph is connected if every pair of nodes is joined at least by one path.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The **shortest path** between two nodes is a path with the minimum number of edges. The **distance** between any two nodes $u$ and $v$ of $G$, denoted $d_{G}(u,v)$, is the length of the shortest path between them. The **diameter** of a graph $G$, denoted $diam(G)$, is the length of the longest shortest path between any pair of nodes of $G$.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Node independent paths** are paths between two nodes that share no nodes in common other than their starting and ending nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "* A **component** of a graph $G$ is a maximal connected subgraph, which means that there is at least one path between any two nodes in that subgraph.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The **density** of a graph $G$, denoted $\\varrho(G)$, measures how many edges are in set $E(G)$ compared to the maximum possible number of edges among nodes in $V(G)$. Thus, density is calculated as $\\varrho(G) = \\frac{2m}{n(n-1)}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "* A **complete graph** is a graph in which all possible edges are present, so its density is 1. A **clique** is an induced subgraph $G[U]$ formed by a subset of nodes $U \\subseteq V(G)$ if, and only if, the induced subgraph $G[U]$ is a complete graph. Thus, there is an edge that links each pair of nodes in a clique. \n",
    "\n",
    "* The **degree** of a node $v$, denoted $deg(v)$, is the number of edges that are incident with $v$. The minimum degree of a graph $G$ is denoted $\\delta(G)$ and it is the smallest degree of a node in $G$.\n",
    "\n",
    "* A $k$-core of $G$ is a maximal subgraph in which all nodes have degree greater or equal than $k$; which means that a $k$-core is a maximal subgraph with the property $\\delta \\ge k$. The **core number** of a node is the largest value $k$ of a $k$-core containing that node.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The removal of a node $v$ from $G$ results in a subgraph $G - v$ that does not contain $v$ nor any of its incident edges.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The **node connectivity** of a graph $G$ is denoted $\\kappa(G)$ and is defined as the minimum number of nodes that must be removed in order to disconnect the graph $G$. Those nodes that must be removed to disconnect $G$ form a **node cut-set**. If it is only necessary to remove one node to disconnect $G$, this node is called an **articulation point**.\n",
    "\n",
    "* We can also define the **local node connectivity** for two nodes $u$ and $v$, denoted $\\kappa_{G}(u,v)$, as the minimum number of nodes that must be removed in order to destroy all paths that join $u$ and $v$ in $G$. Then the **node connectivity** of $G$ is equal to $min{\\{\\kappa_{G}(u,v):u,v \\in V(G)\\}}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Similarly, the **edge connectivity** of a graph $G$ is denoted $\\lambda(G)$ and is defined as the minimum number of edges that must be removed in order to disconnect the graph $G$. The edges that must be removed to disconnect $G$ form an **edge cut-set**.\n",
    "\n",
    "* A **$k$-component** is a maximal subgraph of a graph $G$ that has, at least, node connectivity $k$: we need to remove at least $k$ nodes to break it into more components. The **component number** of a node is the largest value $k$ of a $k$-component containing that node. Notice that $k$-components have an inherent hierarchical structure because they are nested in terms of connectivity: a connected graph can contain several 2-components, each of which can contain one or more tricomponents, and so forth. \n"

    "#### Centrality measures of bipartite graphs\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to compute centrality measures for bipartite graphs we cannot use the same algorithms that we used for unipartite graphs because the normalization of the measures is different. For instance, the degree centrality of a node is defined as the degree of a node divided by the maximum possible degree. In unipartite networks the maximum degree of a node is $n-1$ where $n$ is the total number of nodes of a graph, but in a bipartite graph a node maximum degree is only the total number of nodes in the opposite set; that is, the maximum degree for a woman in our graph is the number of events.\n",
